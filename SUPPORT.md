## Reporting Problems
We use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/pgRouting) to track public bugs. Please ensure your description is clear and has sufficient instructions to be able to reproduce the issue. If possible please provide a minimal demo of the problem. Please follow these steps:

1. Search the tickets to see if your problem has already been reported. If so, add any extra context you might have found, or at least indicate that you too are having the problem. This will help us prioritize common issues.
2. If your problem is unreported, create a new issue for it.
3. In your report include explicit instructions to replicate your issue. The best tickets include the exact SQL necessary to replicate a problem.
4. If you can test older versions of PostGIS for your problem, please do. On your ticket, note the earliest version the problem appears.
5. For the versions where you can replicate the problem, note the operating system and version of pgRouting, PostGIS and PostgreSQL.
